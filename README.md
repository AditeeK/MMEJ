## Introduction

Genomic Sequence Analysis Tool includes two MATLAB scripts:

1. `Main_Exome_100_Shay.m`: A script for identifying homologies in genomic sequences within specified windows.
2. `find_homolog_in_str_Shay.m`: A function used by the main script to find homologies in a given sequence using dot plot analysis.

## Requirements

- MATLAB environment
- The following MATLAB functions should be in the same directory:
    - `my_seqdotplot.m` (not provided in this repository)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/genomic-sequence-analysis.git
